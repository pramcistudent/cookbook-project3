{"changed":true,"filter":false,"title":"README.md","tooltip":"/README.md","value":"# [Cookbook](https:)\n\nThis project is part of my [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development, specifically the **Data Centric Development** module. The objective for this milestone project is to \"*Create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes*\", using the **CRUD** operations of **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete for their recipes.\n## UX\nThis application is an online cookbook - a place where users can find recipes for any occasion. Users can also create their own free account and add any number of recipes which they can share with other users and visitors.\nThe front-end display and functionality uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The back-end functionality uses Python, Flask and MongoDB.\n### User Stories\n\"**_As a user, I would like to_** _____\"\n- view the site from any device (mobile, tablet, desktop). \n- view all recipes as a Guest. \n- filter recipes by Cuisine type. \n- filter recipes by Dish Type.\n- filter recipes by Allergen. \n- create my own account as a registered user.\n- see instructions on how to add a recipe.\n- add my own recipes.\n- edit my own recipes.\n- delete my own recipes.\n- be able to log out.\n### Design\nI received inspiration for the styling of my app from a website I came across called [**_A Basic Cook_**](http://www.abasiccook.com/). I thought the clean simplistic look of the site looked really modern and professional, so I wanted to reflect this in my own app.\n#### Framework\n- [Materialize 1.0.0](https://materializecss.com/)\n    - I really like the modern and clean layout of Materialize as a framework, with its simple-to-understand documentation.\n- [jQuery 3.4.0](https://code.jquery.com/jquery/)\n    - In an effort to keep the JavaScript minimal, I have decided to use jQuery as foundation to my scripts framework.\n- [Flask 1.0.2](http://flask.pocoo.org/)\n    - Flask is a microframework that I've used to render the back-end Python with the front-end Materialize.\n## Features\n### Existing Features\n- **Register Account** - Anybody can register for free and create their own unique account.\n- **Log In to Account** - Allows new users to register for a free account. The form's username field only accepts alphanumeric values.\n- **Log Out of Account** - Allows users to logout of their account by clicking the 'Logout' link in the navbar/sidenav. Upon clicking the button, the user session ends.\n- **Flash Messages** - Displayed at the top of the page below the navbar. These messages differ based on user interaction and provides helper messages for users.\n- **View All Recipe** - On the *home* page pagination is used for the unfiltered results to display 8 recipes per page. The previous page button is only available if there is a previous page. The next page button is only available if there is a next page.\n- **Add a Recipe** - [**C**RUD] Create or 'add' a new recipe will be available for users who are logged in. The 'Add' button is located in navigation bar next to the username. This will take the user to a full page form that will allow them to submit detailed information about a new recipe as well as adding an image (a remotely hosted image, added by URL) dynamically adding and removing ingredients and steps in the recipe method.\n- **View a Recipe** - [C**R**UD] Read or 'review' recipes, either from the main page, or the user recipe page. Users can click on the recipe card to displays the recipe's full details on a page.\n- **Update a Recipe** - [CR**U**D] Update or 'edit' is available only when the user is logged in. Clicking it takes the user to the Edit Recipe page and only the author of the recipe can edit the recipe.\n- **Delete a Recipe** - [CRU**D**] Delete or 'remove' recipe is only available if the user is logged in and if the user added that recipe.\n### Features Left to Implement\nIn an ideal world, there are a couple functions that I would've loved to have completed but didn't have the time or knowledge on how to implement these features.\n- **Hash pass-wording** - This feature is a must for any app that requires users to enter their personal details.\n- **Print / Email** - Being able to print the recipe as well as able to email the recipe to friends and family. This also allows targeted email marketing.\n- **Account profile** - Allows for the user to personalise their account and add additional information about the user such as images etc.\n- **Favorites** - Quick and easy to way for the user to review and store recipes they like.\n- **User comments** - Having a comments section allows for all users to review feedback on recipes.\n- **Date recipe added** - Shows when the recipe was added to the database.\n- **Able to upload images** - Currently you can only use the URL to upload an image, having an additional feature which allows the user to upload from local a drive.\n- **Recipe star ratings** - Upvote is the simplest way for any user to see how popular a recipe is, this can then be used to sort recipes by most liked.\n## Technologies Used\n- [**HTML**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)\n    - The project uses **HTML** to create the basic elements and content of my app.\n- [**CSS**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3)\n    - The project uses **CSS** to apply the custom styles to my app.\n- [**Materialize**](https://materializecss.com/)\n    - The project uses the **Materialize** framework to add a responsive grid system, prebuilt components, plugins built on jQuery, and Materialize styles to my app, before adding my custom styles.\n- [**jQuery**](https://jquery.com)\n    - The project uses **jQuery** as the primary JavaScript functionality. This is both the standard jQuery that is built with Materialize components.\n- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/)\n    - The project uses **Python** as the back-end programming language for my app.\n- [**PyMongo**](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/)\n    - The project uses **PyMongo** as the Python API for MongoDB. This API enables linking the data from the back-end database to the front-end app.\n- [**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/)\n    - The project uses **Flask**, which is a Python microframework.\n- [**Jinja**](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/)\n    - The project uses **Jinja** for templating with Flask in the HTML code. I used **Jinja** to simplify my HTML code, avoid repetition, and allow simpler linking of the back-end to the front-end.\n- [**MongoDB**](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)\n    - The project uses **MongoDB** to store the database in the cloud. The information displayed in the front-end app is pulled from the database store.\n- [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/)\n    - The project uses **Google Fonts** to style the text and suit my chosen theme. The brand logo uses the *_Liu Jian Mao Cao_* font and the rest of the site uses the *_Cairo_* font.\n- [**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/)\n    - The project uses **Font Awesome** for the various icons in my app.\n- [**AWS Educate Cloud9**](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/)\n    - I've used **AWS Educate Cloud9** as the development environment to write the code for my website.\n### Version Control\n- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)\n    - I've used **Git** as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project in AWS Educate Cloud9, before pushing them to GitHub.\n- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/)\n    - I've used **GitHub** as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git.\n### Hosting\n- [**Heroku**](https://www.heroku.com/)\n    - I've used **Heroku** as the hosting platform to deploy my app.\n## Testing\nAll tests were carried out manually.
