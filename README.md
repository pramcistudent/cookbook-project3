# [Cookbook](https:)

This project is part of my [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development, specifically the **Data Centric Development** module. The objective for this milestone project is to "*Create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes*", using the **CRUD** operations of **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete for their recipes.
## UX
This application is an online cookbook - a place where users can find recipes for any occasion. Users can also create their own free account and add any number of recipes which they can share with other users and visitors.
The front-end display and functionality uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The back-end functionality uses Python, Flask and MongoDB.
### User Stories
"**_As a user, I would like to_** _____"
- view the site from any device (mobile, tablet, desktop). 
- view all recipes as a Guest. 
- filter recipes by Cuisine type. 
- filter recipes by Dish Type.
- filter recipes by Allergen. 
- create my own account as a registered user.
- see instructions on how to add a recipe.
- add my own recipes.
- edit my own recipes.
- delete my own recipes.
- be able to log out.
### Design
I received inspiration for the styling of my app from a website I came across called [**_A Basic Cook_**](http://www.abasiccook.com/). I thought the clean simplistic look of the site looked really modern and professional, so I wanted to reflect this in my own app.
#### Framework
- [Materialize 1.0.0](https://materializecss.com/)
    - I really like the modern and clean layout of Materialize as a framework, with its simple-to-understand documentation.
- [jQuery 3.4.0](https://code.jquery.com/jquery/)
    - In an effort to keep the JavaScript minimal, I have decided to use jQuery as foundation to my scripts framework.
- [Flask 1.0.2](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
    - Flask is a microframework that I've used to render the back-end Python with the front-end Materialize.
